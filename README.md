Ping Pong Project Page

Description

I will create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:
1)Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping".
2)Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong".
3)Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong".
The user will also be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.
